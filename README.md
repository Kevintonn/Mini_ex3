My throbber
I wanted to make something with a lot more movement, but i ran into trouble along the way. The main idea was to create something really simple, yet aesthetically pleasing, since i think a throbber shouldn't be feeling too graphically heavy. Smooth movement was a must so i designed the throbber with a high framerate in mind.
